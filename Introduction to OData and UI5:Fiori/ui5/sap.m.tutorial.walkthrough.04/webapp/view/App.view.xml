// we are using the <mvc:View> tag to define the view
// because we are using the MVC pattern
// and the mvc pattern says that the view is responsible for the UI
// the view is responsible for the UI and the controller is responsible for the logic
// the view is responsible for the UI and the model is responsible for the data
